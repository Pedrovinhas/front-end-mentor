## Welcome! üëã

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a website that help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects challenges.

- For my porpose, i will try to implement some features and technologies that i am learning.
- I can change the design to my preferences (color, images etc).

1. üë∂ Newbie (**i'm here**)
2. üéì Junior
3. üßê Intermediate
4. üê±‚Äçüèç Advanced
5. üê±‚Äçüë§ Guru

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. More the difficulty more skills you'll need to solve problems.**

## Challenges Disclaimer

Most of my challenges are build out a website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools i like to help me complete the challenge. So if i've got something i'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

After 5 challenges, i'll advance one level by the time i feel confident.

- Apply 8px grid
- Use SCSS pre-processor
